# GitHub Pages IPFS & OrbitDB Demo
An attempt to run browser based OrbitDB out of a free hosting account.
I have 0 prior experience with IPFS or OrbitDB, so don't expect this to be trustworthy at all.

The IPFS bit is working, even in Chrome in my Android phone.  You can see it here : [yourorg/ghpages-orbitdb-demo](https://yourorg.github.io/ghpages-orbitdb-demo/).
